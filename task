This Python script automates the generation of a sales report by reading data from a CSV file, creating a sales trend plot, and compiling a PDF report. It first checks if the specified CSV file (`data.csv`) exists. If not, it generates a dummy dataset containing sales figures for specific dates and saves it as a CSV file. The script then loads this data into a pandas DataFrame, ensuring it is neither empty nor corrupted. If the data is successfully loaded, a line plot visualizing the sales trend is generated using Matplotlib and saved as an image file (`report_plot.png`). Following this, a PDF report (`custom_report.pdf`) is created using the ReportLab library. The report includes a title, a timestamp indicating when it was generated, the last five sales data points, and, if space permits, the generated sales trend plot. The script is structured to execute these steps in a coordinated manner through the `main()` function, ensuring that the report is generated only if the required data and visualizations are available. This automation is particularly useful for businesses that need consistent and efficient sales reporting without manual intervention.
